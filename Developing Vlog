THIS IS WHERE I WILL PUT UPDATES ON PROGRESS AND RESEARCH

Week 1; 12/25/25 - 01/01/26:

Goals for this week:
I want to keep this week's focus on researching, particularly on AI models and how I can make one.
I want to brainstorm a few ideas for what framework I can use.
I want to see what stuff I would need to overcome

RESEARCH:
-An AI is something that isnt just doing a set program, it needs to learn from the data provided and reach its own end point
-If I make an AI, I have to give it data at first, I can't just make it a bunch of if else commands, and it has to get better as it is used more
-An AI learns from data
-A basic AI learns from data, recognizes PATTERNS, and makes predictions.(The pattern part is what I want to focus on in this project)
-
IDEAS:
  IDEA #1(We'll call it "Alpha"):
    -Make a program that uses data that was previously given to find which one(s) best fit the current data(what is currently going on in the room)
    -It will then use the best fit of data to provide the mood of the current room
    -It will ask the person in the room how accurate it's assumption was, and if accurate, will then store the data for future reference
    -Eventually will not only tell the mood when asked, but will update every minute or so
    -Eventually will also store the results even if it was not right, so it will know what not to do
  IDEA #2(We'll call it "Beta"):
    -Make a program(not AI) that will use already given formulas to output the mood of the room(if all measurements are low, it is calm)
    -This will not store more data on if it was correct or not, but the formulas will be updated as time goes on
    -This can also be done automatically
    -Would be easier(BUT IS LAME)
    -Could use as backup plan...we shall see
ALPHA:
  QUESTIONS:
    -How will it find the best fit?
    -Could I use the line of best fit, or is that different?
    -How much data does it need to be accurate?
    -Could I make it so it shows a graph?
    -How many sensors do I need for an accurate reading?
    -How much will small fluctuations in readings affect it(will they add up)?
    -How can I make it so constant stuff(white noise, light on in the room, someone walking)doesn't affect it too much
    -What sensors do I need to get that data?
