# Mood-of-the-Room
PRE-PROJECT ANALYSIS:

12/25/2025: 8th Grade

  Project Question:
      Can a computer infer the emotional “mood” of a physical space using only simple sensor data? 
      
  Why I want to do this:
      
      I want to explore AI models, and I want to see how accurate I can make one of these models with detecting something which is usually limited to animals. This is my way to explore how code can be a way to do a task which is primarily done by humans. I have never looked into what classifies something as AI, so I think researching this project will teach me a lot, so I am excited.

  My goals for this project:
  
      -Research ways to take measurements on different aspects of the room, such as noise level, light level, and movement.
      -Use a program(AI Model?) to figure out what the different readings could mean.
      -Test in a variety of atmospheres and areas, seeing what will affect the output, either in a positive or negative way.
      -Write an entry on my progress, what I learned, what failed, and my next steps(Will try to do weekly).
      -I want to try to encorporate a sort of an AI model that notices patterns, I need to look into that.
      -Even if I do not accomplish my task, I want to at least learn about this stuff.

  What I want to learn:
  
      -I know that something called signal noise is involved, but don't know what it is, so learning that is a must
      -I want to learn about AI models and what makes them up, I want to see if I can make some simple ones
      -I want to explore heuristics, and I want to see if I can make an AI incorporate a few

  Limitations:
  
      -I am in school doing extracurriculars, so time might be an issue
      -I do not want to spend a lot of money on this, so I will have to try to get most things from previous projects(Arduino from motion sim?)
      -I don't know much about AI models, so this project may not be possible for me
