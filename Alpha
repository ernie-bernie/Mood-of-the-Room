ALPHA:
  BASIC FUNCTIONS:
    -It will take a reading THREE SEPERATE TIMES and average them to find the most accurate data
    -A program that uses data that was previously given to find which one(s) best fit the current data(what is currently going on in the room)
    -It will then use the best fit of data to provide the mood of the current room
    -It will ask the person in the room how accurate it's assumption was, and if accurate, will then store the data for future reference
    -Eventually will not only tell the mood when asked, but will update every minute or so
    -Eventually will also store the results even if it was not right, so it will know what not to do

  QUESTIONS:
    -How will it find the best fit?
    -Could I use the line of best fit, or is that different?
    -How much data does it need to be accurate?
    -Could I make it so it shows a graph?
    -How many sensors do I need for an accurate reading?
    -How much will small fluctuations in readings affect it(will they add up)?
    -How can I make it so constant stuff(white noise, light on in the room, someone walking)doesn't affect it too much
    -What sensors do I need to get that data?

  SPECIFIC RESEARCH:
    -to classify as an AI, it should learn from its past runs
    -Instead of looking for the best fit of data, I could have it graph the points(maybe on a 3D graph depending on the amount of data), and then find the closest point(CALL THIS Alpha.01)

  PROBLEMS:
    -I dont know how to compare different data sets, especially because they are comparing different units/subjects
      -I can't use line of best fit, since different moods could produce the same answer([L:10, N:20, M:10] and [L:10, N:10, M:20])
    -I want to make sure that it is a form of AI, no matter how basic, but I do not really understand the distinctions
    -For Alpha.01, I would need to figure out how to graph the points, and I do not know if that is possible yet
    -For Alpha.01, I want to make sure that it  would find the most correct solution, so finding the closest point may not be enough
