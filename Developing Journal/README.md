# Developing Journals

This folder contains weekly development journals documenting the progress of
the *Mood of the Room* project. These entries focus on the thought process,
questions, challenges, and design decisions made during development.

The purpose of this journal is to track how ideas evolve over time rather than
to present finalized solutions.

## What Each Entry Includes
Each weekly journal may include:
- What was implemented or tested that week
- Research questions that emerged
- Problems or unexpected results
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- Reflections on what worked and what did not

## How to Read This Folder
Entries are organized in seperate files in this folder labeled by the week. Earlier entries may contain
incomplete or incorrect assumptions that were later revised or have multiple different thoughts about the same thing. This is
intentional and reflects the iterative development process.

## Goal
The goal of this journal is to demonstrate continuous learning, curiosity, and
iteration while developing a data-driven system to infer environmental “mood”
from sensor data.
