THIS IS WHERE I WILL PUT UPDATES ON PROGRESS AND RESEARCH

Week 1; 12/25/25 - 01/01/26:

Goals for this week:
  I want to keep this week's focus on researching, particularly on AI models and how I can make one.
  I want to brainstorm a few ideas for what framework I can use.
  I want to see what stuff I would need to overcome
  I want to edit my best idea, making more and more iterations, finalizing an idea by the end of the week

IDEAS:
  IDEA #1(We'll call it "Alpha"):
    -Make a program that uses data that was previously given to find which one(s) best fit the current data(what is currently going on in the room)
    -It will then use the best fit of data to provide the mood of the current room
    -It will ask the person in the room how accurate it's assumption was, and if accurate, will then store the data for future reference
    -Eventually will not only tell the mood when asked, but will update every minute or so
    -Eventually will also store the results even if it was not right, so it will know what not to do

  IDEA #2(We'll call it "Beta"):
    -Make a program(not AI) that will use already given formulas to output the mood of the room(if all measurements are low, it is calm)
    -This will not store more data on if it was correct or not, but the formulas will be updated as time goes on
    -This can also be done automatically
    -Would be easier(BUT IS LAME)
    -Could use as backup plan...we shall see
