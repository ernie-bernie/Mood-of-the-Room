# Developing Journals

This folder contains weekly development journals documenting the progress of
the *Mood of the Room* project. These entries focus on the thought process,
questions, challenges, and design decisions made during development.

The purpose of this journal is to track how ideas evolve over time rather than
to present finalized solutions.

## What Each Entry Includes
Each weekly journal may include:
- Goals I set for that week
- Unanswered research questions that emerged
- Problems or unexpected results that I need to solve
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- Reflections on what worked and what did not
- My next steps

## How to Read This Folder
Earlier entries may contain incomplete or incorrect assumptions that were later revised, or multiple different thoughts about the same thing. This is intentional and reflects the iterative development process.

## Goal
The goal of this journal is to demonstrate continuous learning, curiosity, and
iteration while developing a data-driven system to infer environmental "mood"
from sensor data.
These journals are written as informal engineering notes rather than polished
reports. The emphasis is on capturing reasoning and learning in real time.
